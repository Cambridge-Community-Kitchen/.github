## Welcome to Cambridge Community Kitchen 🥕

We are a food solidarity collective tackling food poverty in Cambridge, UK. We offer free, hot, plant-based meals to those who need them every Thursday and Sunday. 🥦🍅🧑‍🍳

This is where we store the code that underpins our website and food delivery app! 🤓
